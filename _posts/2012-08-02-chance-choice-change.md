Chance, Choice and Change<br/>
Something I call the 3-Cee-Cycle.<br/>
I'm not trying to get into semantics (just a little bit), I just find it fascinating that the three words (chance, choice and change) are all 6 letter-words. 666 hummm... Nothing religious here either, just a mere wordplay and no pun intended.<br/>
Looking at the letters closely, the letter "i" stands out and it is the one letter not shared between the three words aside from "g" and "o"; put together may say "I go". I don't think anyone would disagree with me when I say that we're all presented with chances and choices in this life and it is up to everyone of us to take the chance or make a choice, therefore making a change in our lives. Also note that not taking a chance or making a choice is also considered a decision that affects and makes a change in our lives. Therefore, the letter "i" is you and I who are responsible for the changes we bring to our lives.<br/>
A choice is a chance to make a change, yet a chance is having a choice to make a change. Once a change is made another chance or choice is presented and the cycle starts all over again. So, you can imagine the infinite possibilities our lives could have and will have. Unfortunately, I haven't found a time machine that would take me back to explore the possibilities. On a second thought, I don't want to find the machine since I will get stuck replaying different options at one moment of my life and not move on. Only a masochist would like to experience a single failure in an infinitely different ways.<br/>
After all, to live your life backwards is just evil. "live" reads "evil" backwards, I'm just saying.<br/>
Seize every moment of your life as a product of your own choosing, don't blame anyone else for it. No matter how messy your moment is, there is at least a chance for you to come out clean, learn a thing or two from this life and maybe make the right choice.<br/>
Yours truly,<br/>
