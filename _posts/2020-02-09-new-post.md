Along side the proverb "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me". Getting prepared for repeated situation and deal with them accordingly. Computer tasks are no different. I for one, avoid carpal tunnel syndrome caused by repeated typing. Always assessing time and effort put into running a day-to-day computer tasks and what I'm about to say is valid for any reasonably tedious operation that would take more than a few minutes.
<h4>Perform a task once, perform the same task twice and when I feel I'll be performing the same task for the third time "It's scripted!".</h4>
<pre>
perl -e '$|=1;@s=(1,2);foreach$i(@s){print"$i\b";sleep(1)};print"Script\n"'
</pre>
